Update: Feburary 15th 2024 <br>
>CPOS is now at version 0.3.1 after a long time of inactivity. <br>
Since last update CPOS is now being build upon debian bookworm. <br>
Varius repositories has been added/updated/removed. <br>
Default browser is now Brave and default code editor is now VS Codium. <br>
Finaly I found it necessary to add an optinal caching proxy server <br>
to the build system, so not to get blocked by the repositories and <br>
various other sources for packages and extensions. <br>

>CPOS is now at version 0.1.1 shipping with a bunch of extra repositories. <br>
Next goal is to make a script/program that can write the hybrid iso to a USB flash drive <br>
and create a persistent partition. Afterwards the Update scripts will be implemented.

>Added the basics of an automated test system. This is still very much a work in progress. <br>
In order to get started first create a symlink named 'image-to-be-tested.iso' in the <br>
'images' folder pointing to the desired iso file that is to be tested. <br>
Now go to the 'test' folder and run the commands: `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up --exit-code-from test`.

>It's now possible to use a persistence partition on the USB flash drive. <br>
In order to use this feature it's necessary to have a file named "persistence.conf"
in the root of the file-system that has a volume label named "persistence". <br>
A directory and it's sub dirs can be made persistent by adding a
path to that directory in the "persistence.conf" file i.e. '/home'. <br>
See Manual page persistence.conf(5) for more information.
