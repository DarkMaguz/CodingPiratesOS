# CodingPiratesOS
This is a respin of the Debian linux distro suited for the needs of the Codin Pirates organization.

Priority is to get things up and running. Afterwards we can make things look awesome!
Currently I'm doing 2 things at once.

**TODO**
1) Create a script for setting up our in house laptops.
2) Create a live boot iso.
3) Create an installer for the same iso.
